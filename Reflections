  The results came out. We got 7th place out of the 19 teams that participated, a not good and not bad results,
considering this is the first time i've ever led a team for a competition. The score shows that we lack in general
creativity, that includes the background, features and the pitching video.

  This experience taught me that if i joined a competition and want to win it, i have to give it absolutely my all.
The 7th place result shows that i still need more experience in leading and putting my team on the right path, to remind each other about
the work we need to finish. However, i didn't feel disappointed, i feel proud of our results, i see this
as a great learning experience, failure is always the best teacher.

  Don't be afraid of failing, be afraid of not having the opportunity to fail.
